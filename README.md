# The link for the program written in Python on Replit:
https://replit.com/@maxclere13/project-1-CSCI-360?v=1/

# This function was found on geeks for Geeks to find the closest number to a given key in the list.
 
# This function uses the min() method and the absolute difference of each (alphabet)
# element with K to iterate through the string.The function letterCount() both counts the
# letter frequency and adds those frequencies to a list, ctFreqList.

# The lines start with A through the letter Z. The total count below adds the total frequency
# of all letters in the string. This is needed to calculate the relative frequency of each letter
# compared to the total in the text.

# When the letterCount function is called, it will print the frequency of each letter as
# calculated by countA divided by totalCount. It will also insert these frequencies into a
# new list ctFreqList. The program calls the letterCount function to go through the
# ciphertext string and count the frequencies as discussed above.

# Then we use a for loop to print out the decrypted text after checking the frequency of each
# letter and switching the letters so we can get a text that we can understand.
